# Introduction

This is the root page for course notes from JHU. At the time of writing this introduction I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science. This wiki does not include all the course I've taken from JHU. Specifically, is does not include the Prerequisites that I took and the Foundational Courses for the degree. This is because I started this wiki after taking those courses.
