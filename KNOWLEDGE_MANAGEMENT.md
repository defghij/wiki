# Introduction

I've been slowly developing a knowledge management system for myself. This is a kind of technical, academic, cultural, and personal journal. A place to put both my personal thoughts and class notes.

## Vimwiki

[Vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) serves as the basis for this system. Easily navigating between pages, a personal diary, and all in markdown. It is nearly exactly what I want.

## Mind Map

The idea of a mind map has always appealed to me. However, I've only seen them in the context of a topic or story. What I want is a mind map for my knowledge management system. Truly a map of interconnections between different topics I care about. To that end I think I've found two systems when I can modify to get a solution I'd be happy with:
- [md-graph](https://github.com/barrettotte/md-graph)
- [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph)

### md-graph

The has a nice class to parse a markdown file and generate a json.
