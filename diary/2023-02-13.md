Home sick from work. Been sick all weekend. I think I may have gotten it from Molly. Thankfully, she doesn't seem to have any symptoms.

I'm trying to get an adjacency graph visualizer to work with my vimwiki. But no luck. I had to install the following dependencies:
- networkx
- numpy
- pydot
- graphviz
